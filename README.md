# feedjoy PR Test

<p>
  A minimal tech blog RSS feed congregator. Serving as a centralized proxy for blog posts I personally find valuable.
</p>

<p>
  On a daily basis, feedjoy fetches any new posts across the provided RSS feeds. Posts' content are then run through <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat">OpenAI's API</a> to generate summaries.
